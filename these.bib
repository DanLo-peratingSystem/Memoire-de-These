  abstract = {This paper focuses on the problem of providing efficient run-time support to multimedia applications in a real-time system, where two types of tasks can coexist simultaneously: multimedia soft real-time tasks and hard real-time tasks. Hard tasks are guaranteed based on worst case execution times and minimum interarrival times, whereas multimedia and soft tasks are served based on mean parameters. The paper describes a server-based mechanism for scheduling soft and multimedia tasks without jeopardizing the a priori guarantee of hard real-time activities. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of similar service mechanisms through extensive simulation experiments and several multimedia applications have been implemented on the HARTIK kernel.},

Although GNU/Linux is a widely used operating system, including high-performance systems, it was not designed for safety critical systems. This paper presents a novel isolation concept in order to support a defined independence level in mixed-criticality systems. This novel isolation concept is integrated with the architecture proposed by SIL2LinuxMP. Finally, a simple case study is used to guide the definition of safety techniques and the identification of challenges to be addressed.},

  abstract = {A l'instar du t\'el\'ephone mobile \'evoluant en smartphone, la voiture s'est transform\'ee petit \`a petit en smartcar. Les aides \`a la conduite, l'infotainment ou encore la personnalisation du v\'ehicule sont les points clefs de l'attractivit\'e aupr\`es des consommateurs. L'apparition des v\'ehicules automobiles connect\'es a permis aux constructeurs de mettre \`a jour \`a distance les logiciels embarqu\'es, favorisant leur maintenabilit\'e et l'ajout a posteriori de fonctionnalit\'es. Dans ce contexte, le consortium AUTOSAR, un regroupement de constructeurs automobiles majeurs, a con\c{c}u une nouvelle plate-forme logicielle facilitant la mise \`a jour \`a distance et la modification en ligne de ces syst\`emes embarqu\'es. Cependant, avec de plus en plus de complexit\'e dans ces logiciels, il est devenu essentiel de pouvoir assurer un service s\^ur de fonctionnement malgr\'e des changements impr\'evus. Ainsi, les m\'ecanismes de s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement doivent eux aussi s'adapter et \^etre mis \`a jour pour assurer la r\'esilience du syst\`eme, \`a savoir, la persistance de la s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement face \`a des changements. Les m\'ecanismes de tol\'erance aux fautes (Fault Tolerance Mechanisms - FTM) assurant un service nominal ou d\'egrad\'e en pr\'esence de fautes doivent \'egalement s'adapter face \`a un changement de contexte applicatif (changement du mod\`ele de faute, des caract\'eristiques de l'application ou des ressources disponibles). Cette capacit\'e \`a adapter les FTM est appel\'ee Tol\'erance aux Fautes Adaptative (Adaptive Fault Tolerance \textendash{} AFT). C'est dans ce contexte d'\'evolution et d'adaptativit\'e que s'inscrivent nos travaux de th\`ese. Dans cette th\`ese, nous pr\'esentons des approches pour d\'evelopper des syst\`emes s\^urs de fonctionnement dont les FTM peuvent s'adapter \`a l'ex\'ecution par des modifications plus ou moins \`a grain fin pour minimiser l'impact sur l'ex\'ecution de l'application. Nous proposons une premi\`ere solution bas\'ee sur une approche par composants substituables, nous d\'ecomposons nos FTM selon un sch\'ema de conception Before-Proceed-After regroupant respectivement les actions de s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement s'ex\'ecutant avant une action l'application, la communication avec l'application et celles s'ex\'ecutant apr\`es une action de l'application. Nous impl\'ementons cette approche sur ROS (Robot Operating System), un intergiciel pour la robotique permettant de cr\'eer des applications sous forme de graphe de composants. Nous proposons ensuite une seconde solution dans laquelle nous affinons la granularit\'e des composants de nos FTM et nous cat\'egorisons, dans un premier temps, les actions de s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement qu'ils contiennent. Cela permet non plus de substituer un composant mais une action \'el\'ementaire. Ainsi, nous pallions \`a un probl\`eme de ressource apparu dans l'approche par composants substituables. Un composant \'etant projet\'e sur un processus, nos FTM utilisent inutilement des ressources d\'ej\`a limit\'ees sur les plate-formes embarqu\'es. Pour ce faire, nous proposons une solution bas\'e sur une approche par objets ordonnan\c{c}ables. Les FTM passent d'une conception par graphe de composants \`a une conception par graphe d'objets. Les actions de s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement sont projet\'es sur des objets qui sont ordonnanc\'es \`a l'int\'erieur du FTM. Cette seconde solution est aussi mise en oeuvre sur ROS. Enfin, nous faisons une analyse critique des deux supports d'ex\'ecution logiciel pour l'automobile, \`a savoir, AUTOSAR Classic Plateform, et AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform, qui est en cours de d\'eveloppement encore actuellement. Nous examinons, dans une derni\`ere \'etape la compatibilit\'e entre ces deux supports et nos approches pour concevoir des syst\`emes r\'esilients embarqu\'es bas\'es sur de la tol\'erance aux fautes adaptative.},

Real-time properties of the RTOS are guaranteed by giving it and its tasks the highest priority over CPU utilization. The isolation between the OSes and the highest priority given to the RTOS can lead, however, to a misuse of the CPU resource and high-latency of the other OS tasks. These issues come from the lack of a global vision of the system scheduling needs as each OS schedules its own tasks. We propose to move task scheduling into the virtual machine monitor. There, the Scheduler Virtual Device is in charge of scheduling all the tasks independantly of their hosting OS.},

We show that Fixed-Priority (FP) scheduling of sporadic task sets is sustainable under a variety of scheduling parameter relaxations, including decreased execution requirements, later arrivals, and deadline relaxations. It follows that all sufficient tests of global FP schedulability are sustainable for sporadic task systems. We show that the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) and Earliest-Deadline with Zero Laxity scheduling policies are sustainable with respect to decreased execution requirements and later arrivals. We also introduce a notion of self-sustainability, and show that many widely-used EDF schedulability tests are not selfsustainable but one is.},

  abstract = {A new technique was recently introduced by Bonifaci et al. for the analysis of real-time systems scheduled on multiprocessor platforms by the global Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling algorithm. In this paper, this technique is generalized so that it is applicable to the schedulability analysis of realtime systems scheduled on multiprocessor platforms by any work-conserving algorithm. The resulting analysis technique is applied to obtain a new sufficient global Deadline Monotonic (DM) schedulability test. It is shown that this new test is quantitatively superior to pre-existing DM schedulability analysis tests; in addition, the degree of its deviation from any hypothetical optimal scheduler (that may be clairvoyant) is quantitatively bounded. A new global EDF schedulability test is also proposed here that builds on the results of Bonifaci et al. This new test is shown to be less pessimistic and more widely applicable than the earlier result was, while retaining the strong theoretical properties of the earlier result.},

This paper considers a novel implementation scheme for fixed priority uniprocessor scheduling of mixed criticality systems. The scheme requires that jobs have their execution times monitored (as is usually the case in high integrity systems). An optimal priority assignment scheme is derived and sufficient responsetime analysis is provided. The new scheme formally dominates those previously published.

In particular, (1) we provide a general overview about hardware and operating system features that may have a significant impact on timing and explain their interaction, (2) we identify sources of errors that need to be controlled in order to obtain unbiased measurement results, and (3) we propose a measurement setup for Linux to minimize errors. Although not the focus of this report, we describe the measurement process using hardware performance counters, which can faithfully point to performance bottlenecks on a given processor.

We combine both measurement and analytical approaches into a model for computing probabilistically bounds on the execution time of the worst case path of sections of code. The idea of the technique presented is based on combining (probabilistically) the worst case effects seen in individual blocks to build the execution time model of the worst case path of the program (such case may have not been observed in the measurements). We provide three alternative operators for the combination based on whether the information of their dependency is known. Experimental evaluation of a two case study shows extremely low probabilities of the values obtained by traditional analysis.},

We identify the sources of overheads and show how to take them into account in the feasibility conditions. We compare the theoretical worst case response time obtained with kernel overheads to the response time obtained on a real event driven OSEK implementation. We show that the kernel overheads cannot be neglected and that the theoretical results are valid and can be used for a real-time dimensioning of an OSEK system.},

  abstract = {Research on mixed-criticality scheduling has flourished since Vestal's seminal 2007 paper, but more efforts are needed in order to make these results more suitable for industrial adoption and robust and versatile enough to influence the evolution of future certification standards in keeping up with the times. With this in mind, we introduce a more refined task model, in line with the fundamental principles of Vestal's mode-based adaptive mixed-criticality model, which allows a task's criticality and its importance to be specified independently from each other. A task's importance is the criterion that determines its presence in different system modes. Meanwhile, the task's criticality (reflected in its Safety Integrity Level (SIL) and defining the rules for its software development process), prescribes the degree of conservativeness for the task's estimated WCET during schedulability testing. We indicate how such a task model can help resolve some of the perceived weaknesses of the Vestal model, in terms of how it is interpreted, and demonstrate how the existing scheduling tests for the classic variant's of Vestal's model can be mapped to the new task model essentially without changes.},

Then, we consider transformation problems, where we design synthesis methods to add fault-tolerance to existing fault-intolerant realtime programs. While both problems have been addressed in the literature for untimed programs in theory and practice, there is much to be done for real-time programs. To this end, we concentrate on filling the gap between theory and practice of automated methods for synthesizing realtime programs by characterizing the class of real-time programs and properties, where program synthesis is practically feasible.},

  abstract = {Mixed Criticality Systems (MCSs) have been the focus of considerable study over the last six years. This work has lead to the definition of a standard model that allows processors to be shared efficiently between tasks of different criticality levels. Key aspects of this model are that a system is deemed to execute in one of a small number of criticality modes; initially the system is in the lowest criticality mode, but if any task executes for more than its predefined budget for this criticality level then a mode change is made to a higher criticality mode and all tasks of the lowest criticality level are abandoned (aborted). The initial criticality level is never revisited. This model has been useful in defining key properties of MCSs, but it does not form a useful basis for an actual implementation of a MCS. In this paper we consider the tradeoffs stemming from a consideration of what systems engineers require at run-time and the actual properties of the model that scheduling analysis guarantees. Alternative models are defined that allow low criticality tasks to continue to execute after a criticality mode change. The paper also addresses robust priority assignment.},

This difference in tracing tools and output has to date prevented a direct comparison. This paper reports on a port of cyclictest to LITMUSRT and a case study comparing scheduling latency on a 16-core Intel platform.

Therefore known algorithms either have exponential complexity or at best can be solved in pseudo-polynomial time, thereby restricting the application of the concerned models to a large extent. We introduce the notion of ``approximate schedulability analysis'' and show that if a small amount of ``error'' (which is specified as an input to the algorithm) can be tolerated in the decisions made by the algorithm, then this problem can be solved in polynomial time. Our algorithms are analogous to fully polynomial time approximation schemes in the context of optimization problems. We show that this concept of approximate schedulability analysis is fairly general and can be applied to any task model which satisfies certain ``taskindependence'' assumptions. Lastly, we substantiate our theoretical results with experimental evidence and clearly show the tradeoffs between the running time of the schedulability analysis and the error incurred for various values of the input error parameter.},

  abstract = {Architectures of avionics networks, such as that of the Airbus A380, currently know important evolutions. This is principally due to the increase in the complexity of the embedded systems, in term of rise in number of integrated functions and their connectivity. The evolution of switched Ethernet technologies allows their implementation as an avionics architecture (AFDX: avionics full duplex switched Ethernet). The problem is then to prove that no frame is lost by the network (no switch queue will overflow) and to evaluate the end-to-end transfer delay through the network. The objective of this paper is to present and shortly compare three methods for the evaluation of end-to-end delays: network calculus, queuing networks simulation and model checking},

  abstract = {Partitioned multiprocessor scheduling has been widely accepted in academia and industry to statically assign and partition real-time tasks onto identical multiprocessor systems. This paper studies fixed-priority partitioned multiprocessor scheduling for sporadic real-time systems, in which deadline-monotonic scheduling is applied on each processor. Prior to this paper, the best known results are by Fisher, Baruah, and Baker with speedup factors \$4-\textbackslash frac\{2\}\{M\}\$ and \$3-\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{M\}\$ for arbitrary-deadline and constrained-deadline sporadic real-time task systems, respectively, where \$M\$ is the number of processors. We show that a greedy mapping strategy has a speedup factor \$3-\textbackslash frac\{1\}\{M\}\$ when considering task systems with arbitrary deadlines. Such a factor holds for polynomial-time schedulability tests and exponential-time (exact) schedulability tests. Moreover, we also improve the speedup factor to \$2.84306\$ when considering constrained-deadline task systems. We also provide tight examples when the fitting strategy in the mapping stage is arbitrary and \$M\$ is sufficiently large. For both constrained- and arbitrary-deadline task systems, the analytical result surprisingly shows that using exact tests does not gain theoretical benefits (with respect to speedup factors) for an arbitrary fitting strategy.},

An Actor, Role, Coordinator (ARC) model is proposed [8] to model such software systems as compositions of concurrent computation and coerced coordination. In this paper, we present a framework based on the ARC model, called ARC-AA. The framework is an extension of the Actor Architecture framework [6]. It supports groupwised and decentralized coordination among distributed actors, and the QoS requirements inherent in an ODE system are achieved through the coerced coordination. We focus on fault-tolerance features of the model. In particular, two types of failures, i.e., actor, role, and coordinator crash failures, and timing failures are handled in the ARCAA framework.},

  abstract = {When hosting real-time applications on multicore platforms, interference from shared hardware resources can significantly increase task execution times. Most proposed approaches for lessening interference rely on mechanisms for providing hardware isolation to tasks. However, one limitation of most prior work on such mechanisms is that only static task systems have been considered that never change at runtime. In reality, safety-critical applications often transition among different functional modes, each defined by a distinct set of running tasks. In a given mode, only tasks from that mode execute, yet tasks from all modes consume memory space, and this creates additional constraints affecting hardwareisolation techniques. This paper shows how to address such constraints in the context of an existing real-time resource-allocation framework called MC2 (mixed-criticality on multicore). In MC2, hardware-isolation techniques are employed in conjunction with criticality-aware task-provisioning assumptions that enable hardware resources to be utilized more efficiently.},

  abstract = {Aujourd'hui, le transport a\'erien est l'un des modes de transport les plus s\^urs pour lequel les risques d'incidents depuis les d\'ebuts de l'aviation ne cessent de diminuer. Ces derni\`eres d\'ecennies ont vu les syst\`emes avioniques \'evoluer (connectivit\'e, partage de ressources, COTS) afin d'am\'eliorer l'exp\'erience passager et r\'eduire les co\^uts. Si ces \'evolutions sont ma\^itris\'ees d'un point de vue safety, elles induisent n\'eanmoins de nouveaux vecteurs d'attaque d'un point de vue security. Au regard des attaques r\'ecentes sur des syst\`emes embarqu\'es ou critiques, il devient primordial d'anticiper ce type de menace pour l'avionique. R\'ecemment, plusieurs \'etudes ont vu le jour concernant la s\'ecurit\'e des syst\`emes avioniques. La plupart se concentrent sur les interfaces de l'a\'eronef (moyens de communication ou de mises \`a jour logicielles) ou sur la phase de d\'eveloppement (analyses de risques, tests de vuln\'erabilit\'es). Quelques travaux proposent des mesures de d\'efense en profondeur (durcissement d'OS, d\'etection d'intrusion), notamment pour se prot\'eger d'attaquants internes.Dans cette th\`ese, nous prenons l'hypoth\`ese qu'une application malveillante s'est introduite sur un calculateur avionique. Plus pr\'ecis\'ement, nous \'etudions donc la mise en place d'un syst\`eme de d\'etection d'intrusion au sein d'un calculateur avionique. \'Etant donn\'e l'environnement consid\'er\'e, nous avons formalis\'e six objectifs sp\'ecifiques relatifs \`a l'efficacit\'e de d\'etection, la dur\'ee de vie de l'a\'eronef, les performances, l'impact temps-r\'eel, l'impact sur la s\^uret\'e, et la certification. Pour y r\'epondre, nous proposons une approche compl\`ete permettant d'int\'egrer un syst\`eme de d\'etection d'intrusion sur un calculateur, en se basant sur le processus de d\'eveloppement IMA (Integrated Modular Avionics). Cette approche propose de mod\'eliser le comportement normal d'une application avionique pendant la phase d'int\'egration, en s'appuyant sur les caract\'eristiques statiques et d\'eterministes des applications avioniques, et sur les moyens d\'ej\`a existants pour la safety. Ce mod\`ele de comportement normal est ensuite embarqu\'e \`a bord de l'a\'eronef et permet de d\'etecter toute d\'eviation de comportement pendant la phase d'op\'eration. En compl\'ement, une fonction d'analyse d'anomalies embarqu\'ee offre un premier niveau de diagnostic \`a bord, et une certaine flexibilit\'e une fois l'a\'eronef en op\'eration.Cette approche a \'et\'e impl\'ement\'ee sur deux cas d'\'etude afin de valider sa faisabilit\'e et d'\'evaluer ses capacit\'es de d\'etection et sa consommation de ressources. Un outil d'injection d'attaque a \'et\'e r\'ealis\'e afin de pallier au manque de moyens existants pour tester notre approche. Plusieurs solutions de d\'etection comportementale ont \'et\'e propos\'ees et \'evalu\'ees, en se basant sur deux types de mod\`eles : OCSVM et Automate temporis\'e. Deux impl\'ementations sur calculateur embarqu\'e ont permis d'observer de tr\`es bons r\'esultats en termes d'efficacit\'e de d\'etection et d'utilisation des ressources. Enfin, l'impl\'ementation de la fonction d'analyse d'anomalies et les exp\'erimentations associ\'ees ont donn\'e des r\'esultats encourageants quant \`a la possibilit\'e d'embarquer un tel syst\`eme sur un a\'eronef.},

Even though data-flow graphs are often used for pure data-streaming, many realistic applications can only be specified as conditional task graphs (CTG). The problem of allocating and scheduling conditional task graphs on processors in a distributed real-time system is NP-hard. The first contribution of this paper is a complete stochastic allocation and scheduling framework, where an MPSoC virtual platform is used to accurately derive input parameters, validate abstract models of system components and assess constraint satisfaction and objective function optimization. The optimizer implements an efficient and exact approach to allocation and scheduling based on problem decomposition. The original contributions of the approach appear both in the allocation and in the scheduling part of the optimizer. For the first, we propose an exact analytic formulation of the stochastic objective function based on the task graph analysis, while for the scheduling part we extend the timetable constraint for conditional activities. The second contribution of this paper is the introduction of a software library and API for the deployment of conditional task graph applications onto Multi-Processor System-on-Chips. With our library support, programmers can quickly develop multi-task applications which will run on a multi-core architecture and can easily apply the optimal solution found by our optimizer. The proposed programming support manages OS-level issues, such as task allocation and scheduling, as well as task-level issues, like inter-task communication and synchronization.},

In this paper we consider the real-time systems designed under the DO-178B safety assessment process (i.e., Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification). Vestal introduced a new multiple criticality task model to efficiently take into account criticality levels in the schedulability analysis of such systems. Such a task model represents a potentially very significant advance in the modeling of safety-critical real-time softwares. Baruah and Vestal continue this investigation, with a new scheduling algorithm combining fixed and dynamic priority policies. Another major design issue is to allow a system developer to determine how sensitive is the schedulability analysis to changes in execution time of various software components.},

We propose an efficient algorithm for tuning all relative deadlines of a task set in order to shape the total demand to the available supply of the computing platform.

  abstract = {In classic scheduling theory, real-time tasks are usually assumed to be periodic, i.e. tasks are released and computed with fixed rates periodically. To relax the stringent constraints on task arrival times, we propose to use timed automata to describe task arrival patterns. In a previous work, it is shown that the general schedulability checking problem for such models is a reachability problem for a decidable class of timed automata extended with subtraction. Unfortunately, the number of clocks needed in the analysis is proportional to the maximal number of schedulable task instances associated with a model, which is in many cases huge. In this paper, we show that for fixed-priority scheduling strategy, the schedulability checking problem can be solved using standard timed automata with two extra clocks in addition to the clocks used in the original model to describe task arrival times. The analysis can be done in a similar manner to response time analysis in classic Rate-Monotonic Analysis (RMA). The result is further extended to systems with data-dependent control, in which the release time of a task may depend on the time-point at which other tasks finish their execution. For the case when the execution times of tasks are constants, we show that the schedulability problem can be solved using n + 1 extra clocks, where n is the number of tasks. The presented analysis techniques have been implemented in the Times tool. For systems with only periodic tasks, the performance of the tool is comparable with tools implementing the classic RMA technique based on equation-solving, without suffering from the exponential explosion in the number of tasks.},

Software architects designing certifiable systems have been, until now, restricted to single cores needing to turn off any extra cores on the chip so that the software could be certified to the strict stan- dards imposed by the certification agencies. Modern day multi-core processors offer increased computing power for the same form factor, heat and power which makes them increasingly appealing to developers of embedded appli- cations. In particular, designers are today harnessing the ideas behind software virtualization to consider migrating traditional legacy application from more than one hardware platform onto a central processing platform. That central processing platform would benefit greatly by utilizing a multi-core processor but until now any design that required formal certification was limited to a single core CPU. We will discuss in this paper the challenges multi-core processors bring and how SYSGO's PikeOS has evolved to not only address these issues but implement techniques to achieve the world's first multi-core certification to EN50128 (SIL4) within the Rail industry.},

We present a technique to determine end-to-end latencies of such task sequences. The technique is demonstrated on the example of electronic control units (ECUs) in automotive embedded realtime systems. Our approach is able to deal with multi-core architectures and supports four different activation patterns, including interrupts. It is the first formal analysis approach making use of load assumptions in order to exclude infeasible data propagation paths without the knowledge of worst-case execution times or worst-case response times. We employ a constraint programming solver to compute bounds on end-toend latencies.},

  abstract = {Multicore architectures are increasingly used nowadays in embedded real-time systems. Parallel execution of tasks feigns the possibility of a massive increase in performance. However, this is usually not achieved because of contention on shared resources. Concurrently executing tasks mutually block their accesses to the shared resource, causing non-deterministic delays. Timing analysis of tasks in such systems is then far from trivial. Recently, several analytic methods have been proposed for this purpose, however, they cannot model complex arbitration schemes such as FlexRay which is a common bus arbitration protocol in the automotive industry. This paper considers real-time tasks composed of superblocks, i. e., sequences of computation and resource accessing phases. Resource accesses such as accesses to memories and caches are synchronous, i. e., they cause execution on the processing core to stall until the access is served. For such systems, the paper presents a state-based modeling and analysis approach based on Timed Automata which can model accurately arbitration schemes of any complexity. Based on it, we compute safe bounds on the worstcase response times of tasks. The scalability of the approach is increased significantly by abstracting several cores and their tasks with one arrival curve, which represents their resource accesses and computation times. This curve is then incorporated into the Timed Automata model of the system. The accuracy and scalability of the approach are evaluated with a real-world application from the automotive industry and benchmark applications.},

An implicit assumption, however, is that the best configuration found for any arbitrary data set will work well with other data sets that a program uses. In this article, we evaluate that assumption based on 20 data sets per benchmark of the MiBench suite. We find that, though a majority of programs exhibit stable performance across data sets, the variability can significantly increase with many optimizations. However, for the best optimization configurations, we find that this variability is in fact small. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to find a compromise optimization configuration across data sets which is often within 5\% of the best possible configuration for most data sets, and that the iterative process can converge in less than 20 iterations (for a population of 200 optimization configurations). All these conclusions have significant and positive implications for the practical utilization of iterative optimization.},

  abstract = {Ce document pr\'esente nos contributions aux algorithmes d'ordonnancement \`a criticit\'e mixte pour multi-processeurs. La correction de l'ex\'ecution des applications temps r\'eel critiques est assur\'ee par l'utilisation d'un ordonnancement v\'erifi\'e \`a la conception. Dans ce contexte, le dimensionnement des plate-formes d'ex\'ecution vise \`a minimiser le nombre de processeurs n\'ecessaires pour assurer un ordonnancement correct. Ce dimensionnement est affect\'e par les exigences de s\^uret\'e de fonctionnement. Ces exigences poussent \`a surestimer le temps n\'ecessaire garantissant l'ex\'ecution correcte des applications. Il en d\'ecoule un dimensionnement assez co\^uteux. Les m\'ethodes d'ordonnancement des syst\`emes \`a criticit\'e mixte proposent des compromis sur les garanties d'ex\'ecution des applications am\'eliorant le dimensionnement.  Diff\'erents compromis ont \'et\'e propos\'es mais tous reposent sur la notion de mode d'ex\'ecution. Les modes sont ordonn\'es, et les t\^aches voient leur temps d'ex\'ecution requis cro\^itre avec les modes. Cependant, afin de diminuer le dimensionnement du syst\`eme, seul l'ordonnancement des t\^aches les plus critiques est garanti. Ce mod\`ele est appel\'e "discarding". La majorit\'e des algorithmes propos\'es se limitent \`a deux modes d'ex\'ecutions par simplicit\'e. De plus, les algorithmes les plus efficaces pour multi-processeurs exhibent un nombre \'elev\'e de pr\'eemptions, ce qui constitue un frein \`a leur adoption. Finalement, ces algorithmes sont rarement g\'en\'eralisables. Pourtant, la prise en compte de plus de deux modes, ou de t\^aches aux p\'eriodes \'elastiques permettrait une adoption plus large par le milieu industriel.  L'approche propos\'ee repose sur la s\'eparation des pr\'eoccupations entre la prise en compte des modes de fonctionnement, et l'ordonnancement des t\^aches sur multi-processeurs. Cette m\'ethode permet de concevoir une politique d'ordonnancement efficace et adaptable \`a diff\'erents mod\`eles de syst\`emes \`a criticit\'e mixte. Notre approche consiste \`a transformer un lot de t\^aches \`a criticit\'e mixte en un lot de t\^aches qui n'est plus \`a criticit\'e mixte.  Ceci nous permet d'utiliser un algorithme d'ordonnancement temps r\'eel optimal engendrant peu de pr\'eemptions et de migrations, \`a savoir RUN.  Cette approche, appliqu\'ee en premier pour le mod\`ele discarding avec deux modes d'ex\'ecution, rempli son objectif d'efficacit\'e. Nous illustrons sa g\'en\'ericit\'e en utilisant le m\^eme principe pour ordonnancer des syst\`emes discarding avec plus de deux modes d'ex\'ecution. Enfin, une d\'emarche reposant sur la d\'ecomposition de t\^ache permet de g\'en\'eraliser l'approche au cas des t\^aches \'elastiques.},

In this paper, we propose to use cache space isolation techniques to avoid cache contention for hard realtime tasks running on multicores with shared caches. We present a scheduling strategy for real-time tasks with both timing and cache space constraints, which allows each task to use a fixed number of cache partitions, and makes sure that at any time a cache partition is occupied by at most one running task. In this way, the cache spaces of tasks are isolated at run-time.},

  abstract = {Contemporary multiprocessor real-time operating systems, such as VxWorks, LynxOS, QNX, and real-time variants of Linux, allow a process to have an arbitrary processor affinity, that is, a process may be pinned to an arbitrary subset of the processors in the system. Placing such a hard constraint on process migrations can help to improve cache performance of specific multi-threaded applications, achieve isolation among applications, and aid in loadbalancing. However, to date, the lack of schedulability analysis for such systems prevents the use of arbitrary processor affinities in predictable hard real-time systems. This paper presents the first analysis of multiprocessor scheduling with arbitrary processor affinities from a real-time perspective. It is shown that job-level fixed-priority scheduling with arbitrary processor affinities is strictly more general than global, clustered, and partitioned job-level fixed-priority scheduling combined. Concerning the more general case of joblevel dynamic priorities, it is shown that global and clustered scheduling are equivalent to multiprocessor real-time scheduling with arbitrary processor affinities. The Linux push and pull scheduler is studied as a reference implementation and two approaches for the schedulability analysis of hard real-time tasks with arbitrary processor affinity masks are presented. In the first approach, the scheduling problem is reduced to ``global-like'' sub-problems to which existing global schedulability tests can be applied. The second approach is specifically based on response-time analysis and models the response-time computation as a linear optimization problem. The latter linear-programming-based approach has better runtime complexity than the former reduction-based approach. Schedulability experiments show the proposed techniques to be effective.},

Also, the job's service demand is not known a priori. We are particularly concerned with the case where the workload is heavy-tailed, as is characteristic of many empirically measured computer workloads. We analyze several natural task assignment policies and propose a new one TAGS (Task Assignment based on Guessing Size). The TAGS algorithm is counterintuitive in many respects, including load unbalancing, non-workconserving, and fairness. We find that under heavy-tailed workloads, TAGS can outperform all task assignment policies known to us by several orders of magnitude with respect to both mean response time and mean slowdown, provided the system load is not too high. We also introduce a new practical performance metric for distributed servers called server expansion. Under the server expansion metric, TAGS significantly outperforms all other task assignment policies, regardless of system load.},

  abstract = {Multi-core architectures pose many challenges in real-time systems, which arise from contention between concurrent accesses to shared memory. Among the available memory arbitration policies, Time-Division Multiplexing (TDM) ensures a predictable behavior by bounding access latencies and guaranteeing bandwidth to tasks independently from the other tasks. To do so, TDM guarantees exclusive access to the shared memory in a fixed time window. TDM, however, provides a low resource utilization as it is non-work-conserving. Besides, it is very inefficient for resources having highly variable latencies, such as sharing the access to a DRAM memory. The constant length of a TDM slot is, hence, highly pessimistic and causes an underutilization of the memory. To address these limitations, we present dynamic arbitration schemes that are based on TDM. However, instead of arbitrating at the level of TDM slots, our approach operates at the granularity of clock cycles by exploiting slack time accumulated from preceding requests. This allows the arbiter to reorder memory requests, exploit the actual access latencies of requests, and thus improve memory utilization. We demonstrate that our policies are analyzable as they preserve the guarantees of TDM in the worst case, while our experiments show an improved memory utilization. We furthermore present and evaluate an efficient hardware implementation for a variant of our arbitration strategy.},

Then, the paper proposes a core ontology for modelling a mixed-criticality system at both SoC scale (MCSoC) and SoS scale (MCSoS).

  abstract = {Semi-partitioned scheduling is an approach to multiprocessor real-time scheduling where most tasks are fixed to processors, while a small subset of tasks is allowed to migrate. This approach offers reduced overhead compared to global scheduling, and can reduce processor capacity loss compared to partitioned scheduling. Prior work has resulted in a number of semi-partitioned scheduling algorithms, but their correctness typically hinges on a complex intertwining of offline task assignment and online execution. This brittleness has resulted in few proposed semipartitioned scheduling algorithms that support dynamic task systems, where tasks may join or leave the system at runtime, and few that are optimal in any sense. This paper introduces EDF-sc, the first semi-partitioned scheduling algorithm that is optimal for scheduling (static) soft real-time (SRT) sporadic task systems and allows tasks to dynamically join and leave. The SRT notion of optimality provided by EDF-sc requires deadline tardiness to be bounded for any task system that does not cause over-utilization. In the event that all tasks can be assigned as fixed, EDF-sc behaves exactly as partitioned EDF. Heuristics are provided that give EDF-sc the novel ability to stabilize the workload to approach the partitioned case as tasks join and leave the system.},

  abstract = {In mixed-criticality scheduling, the widely adopted mode-switch scheme assumes that both high- and low-criticality tasks are schedulable when no tasks overrun (normal mode) and all high-criticality tasks are schedulable even when they overrun (critical mode, where low-criticality tasks are abandoned/degraded). However, this scheme greatly impedes the system performance because triggering a mode-switch immediately after any task overruns is abrupt and pessimistic. It is urgent to solve this problem as the mode-switch scheme is a fundamental part in the mixed-criticality scheduling. In this article, we present an on-the-fly fast overrun budgeting mechanism for both, earliest-deadline-first scheduled and fixed-priority scheduled systems that can effectively keep the system ``away'' from the critical mode. Our main idea is to perform overrun budgeting for all tasks as a whole, by monitoring task executions and updating a common overrun budget. This way, the overrun budget is shared among all tasks and adaptively replenished by leveraging run-time information; consequently, mode-switch can be postponed as much as possible. Both, extensive simulations and real-life deployments demonstrate that our proposed mode-switch scheme is lightweight and significantly outperforms existing solutions in improving the system's quality of service for low-criticality tasks.},

  abstract = {Traditional fixed-priority scheduling analysis for periodic task sets is based on the assumption that all tasks are equally critical to the correct operation of the system. Therefore, every task has to be schedulable under the scheduling policy, and estimates of tasks' worst case execution times must be conservative in case a task runs longer than is usual. To address the significant under-utilization of a system's resources under normal operating conditions that can arise from these assumptions, three main approaches have been proposed: priority assignment, period transformation, and zero-slack scheduling. However, to date there has been no quantitative comparison of system schedulability or run-time overhead for the different approaches. In this paper, we present what is to our knowledge the first side-by-side evaluation of those approaches, for periodic mixed-criticality tasks on uniprocessor systems, under a mixed-criticality scheduling model that is common to all three approaches. To make a fair evaluation of zero-slack scheduling, we also address two previously open issues: how to accommodate execution of a task after its deadline, and how to account for previously unidentified forms of interference between mixed-criticality tasks. Our simulations show that while priority assignment and period transformation are most likely to be able to schedule a randomly selected task set, a small fraction of the task sets are schedulable only under the zero-slack approach. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that user-space implementations of mechanisms to enforce period transformation and zero-slack scheduling can be achieved on Linux without kernel modification, with suitably low overhead for mixed-criticality real-time task sets.},

This paper examines the application of dynamic resource management for an integrated time-triggered system architecture for embedded systems, which is designed to support mixedcriticality systems, i.e., systems integrating distributed application subsystems (DASs) with different dependability requirements on the same hardware platform. For such systems a vital characteristic is to achieve encapsulation of the hosted DASs and to provide mechanisms for fault-isolation. The key challenge addressed in this paper is to preserve these system characteristics despite the presence of dynamic resource allocation. To this end, a resource management framework is presented that provides static resource guarantees for DASs having higher dependability requirements, while facilitating efficient resource utilization for less critical DASs.},

As additional threads are being processed concurrently, data in the system's caches can become invalidated and evicted quickly. For latency sensitive workloads, the added delay to fetch the data from system memory can negatively impact the performance. To help prevent this situation from occurring, Intel has developed Cache Allocation Technology (CAT) to enable more control over the LLC cache and how cores allocate into it. Using CAT, the system administrator can reserve portions of the cache for individual cores so that only these cores can allocate into them. As a result, other applications may not evict cache lines from these reserved portions of the cache via general use of the caches. This paper describes the Intel cache hierarchy, how to configure CAT, and scenarios in which CAT can improve performance for latency sensitive applications.},

For many years kernel hackers all over the world tried to accomplish the seemingly infeasible task of achieving good interaction on desktop systems and low latencies on heavily loaded server machines. Some progress has been made in this area since the rise of free software, but, in opinion of many, it is still far from perfect. Lots of beginner operating system enthusiasts find the existing solutions too complex to understand and, in light of almost complete lack of documentation along with common hostility of active kernel developers towards rookies, impossible to get hands on. Anyone who has the courage to wade into the dragon infested layer that is the scheduler, should be aware of the ideas behind current implementations before making any contributions. That is what this thesis is about \textendash{} showing how things work under the hood and how they developed to be like this. Every decision behind each concept in a kernel of an OS has its history and meaning. Here I will guide you through process scheduling mechanisms in currently stable Linux kernel as an object lesson on the matter. The work starts with an overview of the essentials of process abstraction in Linux, and continues with detailed code-level description of scheduling techniques involved in past and present kernels.},

Mixed criticality is often treated purely on hardware or software levels despite the fact that the actual criticality is a system level property. Hence, treating mixed criticality in isolation from the application level can result in missing critical details or overdesigning the system. The metric proposed provides traceability from hardware and software levels to the application system level. Our metric permits numerical quantification of mixedcriticality and is suitable for multi-core architectures with distributed software. We demonstrate usage of our mixed criticality metric on a real-life mechatronics application, a self-balancing Segway-like robot controlled by a multi-core hardware.},

This can be achieved by hosting high-criticality tasks as well as consumer real-time low-criticality tasks on a same chip. The design of such Mixed-Criticality (MC) systems requires the use of an appropriate task model and a specific scheduling strategy. In this work, inspired by the existing elastic task model, we introduce stretching factors as a way for the low-criticality tasks to reduce their utilization, as well as a level of importance in order to define an order for applying these stretching factors. At run-time, the slack time generated by both the over-provisioned high-criticality and the low-criticality tasks is used to maximize the execution rate of the low-criticality tasks. We also show how to integrate this approach in the Time-Triggered paradigm (TT), in particular its impact on the data visibility principle between the low-criticality tasks when they have been stretched.},

The NP-completeness of the problem has instigated researchers to propose different heuristic algorithms. In this paper, we present a Generalized Critical-task Anticipation (GCA) algorithm for DAG scheduling in heterogeneous computing environment. The GCA scheduling algorithm employs task prioritizing technique based on CA algorithm and introduces a new processor selection scheme by considering heterogeneous communication costs among processors for adapting grid and scalable computing. To evaluate the performance of the proposed technique, we have developed a simulator that contains a parametric graph generator for generating weighted directed acyclic graphs with various characteristics. We have implemented the GCA algorithm along with the CA and HEFT scheduling algorithms on the simulator. The GCA algorithm is shown to be effective in terms of speedup and low scheduling costs.},

  abstract = {Message Sequence Charts (MSCs) are widely used for describing interaction scenarios between the components of a distributed system. Consequently, worst-case response time estimation and schedulability analysis of MSC-based specifications form natural building blocks for designing distributed real-time systems. However, currently there exists a large gap between the timing and quantitative performance analysis techniques that exist in the real-time systems literature, and the modeling/specification techniques that are advocated by the formal methods community. As a result, although a number of schedulability analysis techniques are known for a variety of task graph-based models, it is not clear if they can be used to effectively analyze standard specification formalisms such as MSCs. In this paper we make an attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a schedulability analysis technique for MSC-based system specifications. We show that compared to existing timing analysis techniques for distributed real-time systems, our proposed analysis gives tighter results, which immediately translate to better system design and improved resource dimensioning. We illustrate the details of our analysis using a setup from the automotive electronics domain, which consist of two real-life application programs (that are naturally modeled using MSCs) running on a platform consisting of multiple electronic control units (ECUs) connected via a FlexRay bus.},

Our results show that even a simple static drop pattern results in noticeable performance gain for other soft real-time processes and we argue that our dynamic approach, once implemented, will produce even better results.},

In resource augmentation analysis the on-line scheduler is given more resources, say faster processors or more processors, than the adversary.

It is known that there are no constant competitive nonclairvoyant on-line algorithms for these problems. We show that there are simple on-line scheduling algorithms for these problems that are constant competitive if the online scheduler is equipped with a slightly faster processor than the adversary. Thus, a moderate increase in processor speed effectively gives the on-line scheduler the power of clairvoyance. Furthermore, the on-line scheduler can be constant competitive on all inputs that are not closely correlated with processor speed. We also show that the performance of an on-line scheduler in best-effort real time scheduling can be significantly improved if the system is designed in such a way that the laxity of every job is proportional to its length.},

With a focus on fixed-priority preemptive scheduling on each processor, we identify the two main aspects of the problem, namely the task allocation and priority assignment dimensions. For the task allocation dimension, we propose and compare bin-packing-inspired heuristics, based on offline task ordering according to utilization and criticality. For the priority assignment dimension, we compare the wellknown Rate Monotonic priority assignment policy with Audsley's priority assignment algorithm. Through simulations, we also assess and discuss the relative importance of these two primary dimensions on the overall mixed-criticality feasibility problem for multiprocessor platforms.},

Intel recently introduced a new control mechanism, called cache allocation technology (CAT), which controls the cache size used by each application. To intelligently utilize this technology for automated management, it is essential to accurately identify application performance behavior for different cache allocation scenarios. In this work, we show a novel approach which automatically builds a prediction model for application performance changes with CAT. We profile the workload characteristics based on Intel Top-down Microarchitecture Analysis Method (TMAM), and train the model using machine learning. The model predicts instructions per cycle (IPC) across available cache sizes allocated for the applications. We also design a dynamic cache management technique which utilizes the prediction model and intelligently partitions the cache resource to improve application throughput. We implemented and evaluated the proposed framework in Intel PMU profiling tool running on Xeon Platinum 8186 Skylake processor. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed model accurately predicts the IPC changes of applications with 4.7\% error on average for different cache allocation scenarios. Our predictive online cache managements achieves improvements on application performance of up to 25\% as compared to a prediction-agnostic policy.},

  abstract = {The multicore revolution is having limited impact in safety-critical application domains. A key reason is the ``one-out-of-m'' problem: when validating real-time constraints on an m-core platform, excessive analysis pessimism can effectively negate the processing capacity of the additional m-1 cores so that only ``one core's worth'' of capacity is utilized even though m cores are available. Two approaches have been investigated previously to address this problem: mixed-criticality allocation techniques, which provision less-critical software components less pessimistically, and hardware-management techniques, which make the underlying platform itself more predictable. A better way forward may be to combine both approaches, but to show this, fundamentally new criticality-cognizant hardware-management tradeoffs must be explored. Such tradeoffs are investigated herein in the context of a new variant of a mixed-criticality framework, called MC2, that supports configurable criticality-based hardware management. This framework allows specific DRAM memory banks and areas of the last-level cache (LLC) to be allocated to certain groups of tasks. A linear-programming-based optimization framework is presented for sizing such LLC areas, subject to conditions for ensuring MC2 schedulability. The effectiveness of the overall framework in resolving hardware-management and scheduling tradeoffs is investigated in the context of a large-scale overhead-aware schedulability study. This study was guided by extensive trace data obtained by executing benchmark programs on the new variant of MC2 presented herein. This study shows that mixed-criticality allocation and hardware-management techniques can be much more effective when applied together instead of alone.},

Specifically, we (i) formally specify each layer of abstraction in consort with timing and energy properties, and (ii) evaluate an optimized policy for design validation as well as provide a time-energy critical path for further optimization that will cost-effectively address the Quality of Service (QoS)/performance tradeoffs. By providing a design flow that includes both timing verification and cross layer optimization, we can achieve (i) timing guarantees for design verification, (ii) better optimizations for resource management, and (iii) adaptive parameter settings for resource sharing and energy minimization. We present preliminary results on an MPEG application.},

In this paper, we address this problem when several high criticality tasks with different deadlines, periods and offsets are concurrently executed on the system. We propose a distributed run-time WCET controller that works as follows: (1) locally, each critical task regularly checks if the interferences due to the low criticality tasks can be tolerated, otherwise it decides their suspension; (2) globally, a master suspends and restarts the low criticality tasks based on the received requests from the critical tasks.

In particular, it led to the definition of ASIL (Automotive Safety and Integrity Levels), i.e., it formally defines several criticality levels. Handling the increased complexity of new services makes new architectures, such as multi or many-cores, appealing choices for the car industry. Yet, these architectures provide a very low level of timing predictability due to shared resources, which goes in contradiction with timing guarantees required by ISO 26262.},

To improve the system performance, we propose an approach where a critical task can run in parallel with less critical tasks, as long as the real-time constraints are met.

  abstract = {Recent years have seen an increasing interest in the scheduling of mixed-criticality real-time systems. These systems are composed of groups of tasks with different levels of criticality deployed over the same processor(s). Such systems must be able to accommodate additional execution-time requirements that may occasionally be needed. When overload conditions develop, critical tasks must still meet their timing constraints at the expense of less critical tasks. Zero-slack scheduling algorithms are promising candidates for such systems. These algorithms guarantee that all tasks meet their deadlines when no overload occurs, and that criticality ordering is satisfied under overloads. Unfortunately, when mutually exclusive resources are shared across tasks, these guarantees are voided. Furthermore, the dualexecution modes of tasks in mixed-criticality systems violate the assumptions of traditional real-time synchronization protocols like PCP and hence the latter cannot be used directly. In this paper, we develop extensions to real-time synchronization protocols (Priority Inheritance and Priority Ceiling Protocol) that coordinate the mode changes of the zero-slack scheduler. We analyze the properties of these new protocols and the blocking terms they introduce. We maintain the deadlock avoidance property of our PCP extension, called the Priority and Criticality Ceiling Protocol (PCCP), and limit the blocking to only one critical section for each of the zero-slack scheduling execution modes. We also develop techniques to accommodate the blocking terms arising from synchronization, in calculating the zeroslack instants used by the scheduler. Finally, we conduct an experimental evaluation of PCCP. Our evaluation shows that PCCP is able to take advantage of the capacity of zero-slack schedulers to reclaim unused over-provisioning of resources that are only used in critical execution modes. This allows PCCP to accommodate larger blocking terms.},

  abstract = {Large-scale distributed cyber-physical systems will have many sensors/actuators (each with local micro-controllers), and a distributed communication/computing backbone with multiple processors. Many cyber-physical applications will be safetycritical and in many cases unexpected workload spikes are likely to occur due to unpredictable changes in the physical environment. In the face of such overload scenarios, the desirable property in such systems is that the most critical applications continue to meet their deadlines. In this paper, we capture this mixedcriticality property by developing a formal overload-resilience metric called ductility. The generality of ductility enables it to evaluate any scheduling algorithm from the perspective of mixedcriticality cyber-physical systems. In distributed cyber-physical systems, this ductility is the result of both the task-to-processor packing (a.k.a bin packing) and the uniprocessor scheduling algorithms used. In this paper, we present a ductility-maximization packing algorithm to complement our previous work on mixedcriticality uniprocessor scheduling [6]. Our packing algorithm, known as Compress-on-Overload Packing (COP) is a criticalityaware greedy bin-packing algorithm that maximizes the tolerance of high-criticality tasks to overloads. We compare the ductility of COP against the Worst-Fit Decreasing (WFD) bin-packing heuristic used traditionally for load balancing in distributed systems, and show that the performance of COP dominates WFD in the average case and can reach close to five times better ductility when resources are limited. Finally, we illustrate the practical use of COP in distributed cyber-physical systems using a radar surveillance application, and provide an overview of the entire process from assigning task criticality levels to evaluating its performance.},

  abstract = {Multi-core processors are already prevalent in general-purpose computing systems with manufacturers currently offering up to a dozen cores per processor. Real-time and embedded systems adopting such processors gain increased computational capacity, improved parallelism, and higher performance per watt. However, using multi-core processors in real-time applications also introduces new challenges and opportunities for efficient scheduling and task synchronization. In this dissertation, we study this problem, characterize the design space, and develop an analytical and systems framework for multi-core real-time scheduling. Exploiting the co-located nature of processor cores, the general principle adopted in this thesis is to statically partition tasks among processor cores, co-allocate synchronizing tasks when possible, and introduce limited inter-core task migration and synchronization for improving system utilization as necessary. We model the multi-core real-time scheduling problem as a bin-packing problem and develop an object splitting algorithm for scheduling tasks on multi-core processors. We develop Highest-Priority Task Splitting (HPTS) to schedule independent sequential tasks on multi-core processors. We then analyze the overheads of inter-core task synchro- nization and provide mechanisms to efficiently allocate synchronizing sequential tasks on multi- cores by co-locating such tasks. We then generalize this approach to provide early solutions for scheduling parallel real-time tasks using the fork-join model. Next, we develop mechanisms to use such techniques in mixed-criticality systems. Finally, we describe the distributed resource kernel framework, where we demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach. The results of this dissertation contribute to a system that can efficiently utilize multi-core processors to predictably execute periodic tasks with well-defined deadlines and analytically guarantee such deadlines. We provide a utilization bound of 65\% for independent sequential tasks, demonstrate up to 50\% reduction in the required number of cores using synchronization-aware allocation, and prove a 3.42 resource augmentation bound for parallel real-time task scheduling.},

ZKP has great potentials to be used for creating spoof-free trust chains among hostile peer computing systems. Given the critical nature of trust chains, the temporal behaviors and the operational overheads of ZKP need to be adequately addressed. In this work-in-progress article, we report preliminary results on how to guarantee the security properties of timed ZKP (TZKP) protocols locked into the logical clocks for session based resource access. Preliminary findings suggest that security vulnerability can be prevented with reduced overheads after proper refinements to the disposable authentication protocols.},

Because of their critical nature, such systems have to meet strict timing properties. To help the designers to prove the correctness of their system, the real-time systems community has developed numerous approaches for analysing the worst case scenarios either on the processors (e.g., worst case response time of a task) or on the networks (e.g., worst case traversal time of a message). These approaches provide results only for local components behaviours. However, there is a growing need for having a global view of the system, in order to determine end-to-end properties. Such a property applies to functional chains which describe the behaviour of sequences of tasks. We propose an approach to analyse worst case behaviour along functional chains in critical embedded systems. It is based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and is general in the sense that it can be applied to a variety of end-to-end properties. This paper focuses on two essential properties: end-to-end latency and temporal consistency. This work was supported by the French National Research Agency within the SATRIMMAP project.},

For dependable embedded systems, the challenge is even greater, as evolution must not impair dependability attributes. Resilient computing implies maintaining dependability properties when facing changes. Resilience encompasses several aspects, among which evolvability, i.e., the capacity of a system to evolve during its service life. In this paper, we discuss the evolution of systems with respect to their dependability mechanisms, and show how such mechanisms can evolve accordingly. From a component-based approach that enables to clarify the concepts, the process and the techniques to be used to address resilient computing, in particular regarding the adaptation of fault tolerance (or safety) mechanisms, we show how Adaptive Fault Tolerance (AFT) can be implemented with ROS. Beyond implementation, we draw the lessons learned from this work and discuss the limits of this runtime support to implement such resilient computing features in embedded systems.},

A great number of scheduling theories have been developed for verification of the temporal correctness of jobs (software) in such systems. Among them, the Earliest Deadline first until Zero-Laxity (EDZL) scheduling algorithm has received growing attention thanks to its effectiveness in multicore realtime scheduling. However, the true potential of EDZL has not yet been fully exploited in its schedulability analysis as the state-of-the-art EDZL analysis techniques involve considerable pessimism. In this paper, we propose a new EDZL multicore schedulability test. We first introduce an interesting observation that suggests an insight toward pessimism reduction in the schedulability analysis of EDZL. We then incorporate it into a well-known existing Earliest Deadline First (EDF) schedulability test, resulting in a new EDZL schedulability test. We demonstrate that the proposed EDZL test not only has lower time complexity than existing EDZL schedulability tests, but also significantly improves the schedulability of EDZL by up to 36.6 percent compared to the best existing EDZL schedulability tests.},

Future scenarios, however, call for more flexible configuration support. DySCAS (Dynamically Self-Configuring Automotive Systems) project aims to introduce context-awareness and self-management features into automotive embedded systems via middleware technologies. Contributing to online configuration decisions, this paper formalizes a fundamental self-configuration problem. It forms a basis for managing the cross interdependencies of configurational items, assessing the system-wide impacts of changes, and making dynamic decisions about new configurations.},

However, only a subset of the functionality of the system may be safety-critical and hence subject to certification; the rest of the functionality is non safety-critical and does not need to be certified. Certification requirements in such ``mixedcriticality'' systems give rise to some interesting scheduling problems, that cannot be satisfactorily addressed using techniques from conventional scheduling theory. In prior work, we have studied the scheduling and analysis of mixed criticality systems that are specified as finite collections of jobs executing on a single shared preemptive processor. In this paper, we consider mixed criticality systems that are comprised of finite collections of recurrent tasks, specified using a mixed-criticality generalization of the widelyused sporadic tasks model. We design a priority-based algorithm for scheduling such systems, derive an algorithm for computing priorities, and obtain a sufficient schedulability condition for efficiently determining whether a given mixed-criticality system can be successfully scheduled by this algorithm.},

  abstract = {This dissertation addresses the following question to the design of scheduling policies and resource allocation mechanisms in contemporary embedded systems that are implemented on integrated computing platforms:  in a multitasking system where it is hard to estimate a task's worst-case execution time, how do we assign task priorities so that 1) the safety-critical tasks are asserted to be completed within a specified length of time, and 2) the non-critical tasks are also guaranteed to be completed within a predictable length of time if no task is actually consuming time at the worst case? This  dissertation  tries  to  answer  this  question  based  on  the  mixed-criticality  real-time system model, which defines multiple worst-case execution scenarios, and demands a scheduling policy to provide provable timing guarantees to each level of critical tasks with respect to each type of scenario.  Two scheduling algorithms are proposed to serve this model.  The OCBP algorithm is aimed at discrete one-shot tasks with an arbitrary number of criticality levels.  The EDF-VD algorithm is aimed at recurrent tasks with two criticality levels (safety-critical and non-critical).  Both algorithms are proved to optimally minimize the percentage of computational resource waste within two criticality levels.  More in-depth investigations to the relationship among the computational resource requirement of different criticality levels are also provided for both algorithms.},

  abstract = {(m,k)-firm constraints have been used to schedule tasks in firm real-time systems under overloaded conditions. In general, they are provided by application designers to guarantee the minimum levels of quality of service (QoS). Many problems focusing on task schedulability under these constraints were investigated in the last ten years. However, little work has been done in combining the optimization of the QoS and tasks schedulability subject to these (m,k)-firm constraints. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the guaranteed performance while maintaining a schedulable task set in periodic firm real-time systems. To quantify the performance, we propose a granularity-related metric called Granularity of Quality of Service - Reward (GQoS- reward). We then show that maximizing the total GQoS-reward is an NP-Hard problem. We conclude the paper by laying out a preliminary framework for solving this problem.},

On such systems, a real-time task may exhibit different WCETs (Worst Case Execution Times) in different criticality modes. It is well-known that traditional real-time scheduling methods are not applicable to ensure the timely requirement of the mixed-criticality tasks. In this paper, the authors study a problem of scheduling real-time, mixed-criticality tasks with fault tolerance. An optimal, off-line algorithm is designed to guarantee the most tasks completing successfully when the system runs into the high-criticality mode. A formal proof of the optimality is given. Also, a novel on-line slack-reclaiming algorithm is proposed to recover from computing faults before the tasks' deadline during the run-time. Simulations show that an improvement of about 30\% in performance is obtained by using the slack-reclaiming method.},

As simple as it may seem, we found that this invariant is often broken in Linux. Cores may stay idle for seconds while ready threads are waiting in runqueues. In our experiments, these performance bugs caused many-fold performance degradation for synchronization-heavy scientific applications, 13\% higher latency for kernel make, and a 1423\% decrease in TPC-H throughput for a widely used commercial database. The main contribution of this work is the discovery and analysis of these bugs and providing the fixes. Conventional testing techniques and debugging tools are ineffective at confirming or understanding this kind of bugs, because their symptoms are often evasive. To drive our investigation, we built new tools that check for violation of the invariant online and visualize scheduling activity. They are simple, easily portable across kernel versions, and run with a negligible overhead. We believe that making these tools part of the kernel developers' tool belt can help keep this type of bug at bay.},

However, the integration of software components is error-prone, if their coordination is not rigorously controlled.

Most of dependability mechanisms, today, address locally errors within each component or report them to further diagnosis services. Instead, we consider a global wrapping-based approach to deal with multilevel properties to be checked on the complete multilayered system at runtime.

This is not even true in an approximate sense in a modern multi-core chip, due to interference caused by hardware resource sharing. In this work we propose (1) a complete framework to analyze and profile task memory access patterns and (2) a novel kernel-level cache management technique to enforce an efficient and deterministic cache allocation of the most frequently accessed memory areas. In this way, we provide a powerful tool to address one of the main sources of interference in a system where the last level of cache is shared among two or more CPUs. The technique has been implemented on commercial hardware and our evaluations show that it can be used to significantly improve the predictability of a given set of critical tasks.},

Because of the extreme complexity of the problem, an exact solution is practically impossible to be obtained even for toy examples. Therefore, our methodology is based on approximating the generalized probability distributions of execution times by Coxian distributions of exponentials. Thus, we transform the generalized semi-Markov process, corresponding to the initial problem, into a continuous Markov chain (CTMC) which, however, is extremely large and, hence, most often is impossible to be stored in memory. We have elaborated a solution which allows to generate and analyze the CTMC in an efficient way, such that only a small part has to be stored at a given time. Several experiments investigate the impact of various parameters on complexity, in terms of time and memory, as well as the trade-offs regarding the accuracy of generated results.},

In the past decade, the limitations of models considering fixed (worst case) task execution times have been acknowledged for large application classes within soft real-time systems. A more realistic model considers the tasks having varying execution times with given probability distributions. No restriction has been imposed in this thesis on the particular type of these functions. Considering such a model, with specified task execution time probability distribution functions, an important performance indicator of the system is the expected deadline miss ratio of tasks or task graphs. This thesis proposes two approaches for obtaining this indicator in an analytic way. The first is an exact one while the second approach provides an approximate solution trading accuracy for analysis speed. While the first approach can efficiently be applied to mono-processor systems, it can handle only very small multi-processor applications because of complexity reasons. The second approach, however, can successfully handle realistic multi-processor applications. Experiments show the efficiency of the proposed techniques.},

Cependant, les mises \`a jour et la personnalisation des syst\`emes embarqu\'es sont de plus en plus, non seulement pl\'ebiscit\'es, mais \'egalement n\'ecessaires. En effet, la complexit\'e grandissante des syst\`emes exige \`a pr\'esent de d\'eployer des moyens suppl\'ementaires pour permettre leur maintenance et leur \'evolution de mani\`ere plus ais\'ee. Ainsi, partant de ces constats, ce travail \'etudie les possibilit\'es de faire des mises \`a jour dans le contexte d'AUTOSAR. Les modifications n\'ecessaires se retrouvent non seulement dans l'architecture, mais \'egalement au sein du processus de d\'eveloppement et des consid\'erations temps-r\'eel.

Cette th\`ese d\'ecrit donc le processus de d\'eveloppement logiciel AUTOSAR et propose certaines am\'eliorations mises en place au cours de ce travail.

  abstract = {Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) typically implement complex applications, each consisting of multiple tasks. Several applications share the SoC cores, to reduce cost. Applications have mixed time-criticality, i.e., real-time or not, and are typically developed together with their schedulers, by different parties. Composability, i.e., complete functional and temporal isolation between applications, is an SoC property required to enable fast integration and verification of applications. To achieve composability, an Operating System (OS) allocates processor time in quanta of constant duration. The OS executes first the application scheduler, then the corresponding task scheduler, to determine which task runs next. As the OS should be a trusted code base, both inter- and intra-application schedulers should be thoroughly analysed and verified. This is required anyway for real-time intraapplication schedulers. But for non-real-time applications, a costly effort is required to achieve the desired confidence level in their intra-application schedulers. In this paper we propose a light-weight, real-time OS implementation that overcomes these limitations. It separates the two arbitration levels, and requires only the inter-application scheduler to run in OS time. The intra-application scheduler runs in user time, and is therefore not trusted code. This approach allows each application to execute its own specialised task scheduler. We evaluated the practical implications of our proposal on an SoC modelled in FPGA, running an H264 and a JPEG decoder and we found that composability is preserved and performance is improved with up to 37\%.},

  abstract = {The complexity of electronic embedded systems in cars is continuously growing. Hence, mastering the temporal behavior of such systems is paramount in order to ensure the safety and comfort of the passengers. As a consequence, the verification of end-to-end real-time constraints is a major challenge during the design phase of a car. The AUTOSAR software architecture drives us to address the verification of end-to-end real-time constraints as two independent scheduling problems respectively for electronic control units and communication buses. First, we introduce an approach, which optimizes the utilization of controllers scheduling numerous software components that is compatible with the upcoming multicore architectures. We describe fast and efficient algorithms in order to balance the periodic load over time on multicore controllers by adapting and improving an existing approach used for the CAN networks. We provide theoretical result on the efficiency of the algorithms in some specific cases. Moreover, we describe how to use these algorithms in conjunction with other tasks scheduled on the controller. The remaining part of this research work addresses the problem of obtaining the response time distributions of the messages sent on a CAN network. First, we present a simulation approach based on the modelisation of clock drifts on the communicating nodes connected on the CAN network. We show that we obtain similar results with a single simulation using our approach in comparison with the legacy approach consisting in numerous short simulation runs without clock drifts. Then, we present an analytical approach in order to compute the response time distributions of the CAN frames. We introduce several approximation parameters to cope with the very high computational complexity of this approach while limiting the loss of accuracy. Finally, we compare experimentally the simulation and analytical approaches in order to discuss the relative advantages of each of the two approaches.},

Verifying such systems requires checking two types of properties: functional and real-time. For functional properties, a standard approach for ensuring correctness is Design by Contract: annotating programs with executable pre- and postconditions. We extend contracts for specifying real-time properties. In the industry, components are often bought from vendors and meant to be used off-the-shelf which makes it very difficult to determine their execution times and express related properties. We present a solution to this problem by using statistical inference for estimating the properties. The contract framework allows application developers to express contracts like "the execution time of component X lies within gamma standard deviations from the mean execution time". Experiments based on industrial case studies show that this framework can be smoothly integrated into existing control applications, thereby increasing their reliability while having an acceptable execution time overhead (less than 10\%).},

  abstract = {Computing Worst-Case Execution Times (WCETs) for applications executed on multi-core processors is a challenging topic since possible interferences on shared resources need to be considered. Some approaches are already proposed in literature, but the problem is still not sufficiently solved. Different approaches suffer different shortcomings. For instance, the mutual analysis of multiple applications leads to great computational complexity, pessimistic assumptions on the interference between tasks causes highly overestimated WCETs and resource privatisation dissipates processor resources. In this paper we tackle the problems of overestimated WCETs due to pessimistic analysis and differences between average-case and worst-case execution timing. We introduce a new computing paradigm for safety-critical real-time systems, which enables Quality of Service (QoS) properties to increase the utilisation of multi-core processors while still guaranteeing bounds on the worst-case behavior. This paradigm is one approach to raise multi-core performance over single-core processors, even for hard real-time systems. For evaluation we use abstractions of real applications. The concepts are implemented on Freescale's P4080 multi-core processor and AbsInt's timing analysis framework aiT. The results show an increased processor core and system utilisation of up to 99.9\% and 59.3\% respectively, while still providing hard deadline guarantees for all applications.},

The shared information can be used to realize new functionalities, from virtual traffic lights to emergency braking, thus with potential to increase safety and efficiency of vehicle systems. However, external information has inherent uncertainties and this poses a threat to safety. In this paper we will discuss how to handle these uncertainties by use of dynamic safety contracts. We propose an extension to AUTomotive Open System Architecture (AUTOSAR) which consists of a safety manager which actively enforces the safety rules described in such safety contract. We also propose to integrate the architecture of an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) station tightly to AUTOSAR. It is our hypothesis that such architecture provides a viable platform for run time safety assessment. Future research work is to evaluate what kind of safety assessments our system can be able to handle.},

In particular, in a mixed-criticality system, low criticality applications must be prevented from interfering with high criticality ones. In this paper, we introduce a new design methodology for SoC that provides strong isolation guarantees to applications with different criticalities. A set of certificates describing the assumed application behavior is extracted from a functional Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL) specification. Our tools then automatically generate hardware wrappers that enforce at run-time the behavior described by the certificates. In particular, we employ run-time monitoring to formally check all data communication in the system, and we enforce timing reservations for both computation and communication resources. Verification is greatly simplified because certificates are much simpler than the components used to implement low-criticality applications. The effectiveness of our methodology is proven on a case study consisting of a medical pacemaker.},

  abstract = {Due to the rising complexity of automotive Electric/Electronic embedded systems, Functional Safety becomes a main issue in the automotive industry. This issue has been formalized by the introduction of the ISO 26262 standard for functional safety in 2011. The challenges are, on the one hand to design safe systems based on a systematic verification and validation approach, and on the other hand, the fulfilment of the requirements of the ISO 26262 standard. Following ISO 26262 recommendations, our approach, based on fault injection, aims at verifying fault tolerance mechanisms and non-functional requirements at all steps of the development cycle, from early design phases down to im-plementation. Fault injection is a verification technique that has been investigated for a long time. However, the role of fault injection during design phase and its complementarities with the experimental validation of the target have not been explored. In this work, we investigate a fault injection continuum, from system design validation to experiments on implemented targets. The proposed approach considers the safety analyses as a starting point, with the identification of safety mechanisms and safety requirements, and goes down to the validation of the implementation of safety mechanisms through fault injection ex-periments. The whole approach is based on a key fault injection framework, called FARM (Fault, Ac-tivation, Readouts and Measures). We show that this approach can be integrated in the development process of the automotive embedded systems described in the ISO 26262 standard. Our approach is illustrated on an automotive case study: a Front-Light system.},

As automotive software typically implements safety-critical functions, it needs to fulfill high dependability requirements, and the effort put into the quality assurance of these systems is correspondingly high. Testing, fault injection (FI), and other techniques are employed for the experimental dependability assessment of these increasingly software-intensive systems. Having flexible and automated support for instrumentation is key in making these assessment techniques efficient. However, providing a usable, customizable and performant instrumentation for AUTOSAR is non-trivial due to the varied abstractions and high complexity of these systems. This paper develops a dependability assessment guidance framework tailored towards AUTOSAR that helps identify the applicability and effectiveness of instrumentation techniques at (a) varied levels of software abstraction and granularity, (b) at varied software access levels - black-box, grey-box, white-box, and (c) the application of interface wrappers for conducting FI.},

We consider rate-based processes as a separate class of soft real-time processes because they do not have timing constraints in the form of deadlines. Instead, they have continuous processing requirements in terms of the constant rate. The goal of the efficient scheduling mechanism for rate-based processes as part of an integrated system is to provide good overall system performance (good performance of all classes of processes in the system) while maintaining the required throughput of rate-based processes.},

  abstract = {As mobile and embedded devices become widespread, the management and configuration of the software in the devices is increasingly turning into a critical issue. OSGi is a business standard for the life cycle management of Java software components. It is based on a service oriented architecture where functional units are decoupled and components can be managed independently of each other. However, the focus continuously shifts from the originally intended area of small and embedded devices towards large-scaled enterprise systems. As a result, implementations of the OSGi framework are increasingly becoming more heavyweight and less suitable for smaller computing devices. In this paper, we describe the experience gathered during the design of Concierge, an implementation of the OSGi specification tailored to resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive benchmarks show that Concierge performs better than existing implementations and consumes less resources.},

In addition, these systems are increasingly deployed on multiprocessor platforms because this can help to reduce their cost, space, weight, and power consumption. To assure the safety of such systems, several mixed-criticality scheduling algorithms have been developed that can provide mixed-criticality timing guarantees. However, most existing algorithms have two important limitations: they do not guarantee strong isolation among the high-criticality tasks, and they offer poor real-time performance for the low-criticality tasks.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the partitioned EDF-VD scheduling problem of mixed critical systems with two criticality levels (LO and HI) on identical multiprocessors. Partitioned scheduling is an NP-hard problem that has been widely studied in the literature. The most common metaheuristic to solve partitioning problems consists in ordering tasks by a given criteria (such as task utilization) then assign tasks to processors in that order, choosing which processor using a heuristic rule such as First Fit or Best Fit. The current state of the art results show that First Fit Decreasing Density provides the best success ratio for single-criticality scheduling. In the context of mixedcriticality, we would like to investigate whether this is also true for assigning LO and HI critical tasks to processors. We consider two cases, one called ``criticality aware'' that first tries to assign HI tasks to processors and then LO tasks separately and the other one called ``criticality unaware'' that assigns tasks without taking their criticality into account. We test the performance of all combinations of sorting/partitioning heuristics in both cases, which leads to 1024 different heuristics in the aware case and 32 in the unaware case. We define two search algorithms to efficiently find which of these heuristics obtains the best success ratio. In addition, a new mixed-criticality multiprocessor random task set generation algorithm is proposed.},

Nevertheless, it is unlikely that all functionalities share the same level of criticality, and certification of the system has to be achieved using varying degrees of rigorousness. Typically, a task {$\tau$}i is guaranteed to meet its temporal constraints up to a criticality level that is equal to its own criticality. When those conditions are no longer met, i.e. when another higher priority task {$\tau$}j has its execution time that exceeds its Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) w.r.t. the criticality level of {$\tau$}i, a common approach is to suspend {$\tau$}i. However, in some cases, it may not be necessary to suspend tasks with a lower criticality immediately as they could still be executed without compromising the deadlines of high criticality tasks. As a step towards this aim, we propose a method, denoted Latest Completion Time (LCT), that allows lower criticality tasks to proceed with their execution as long as they do not prevent higher criticality tasks from meeting their deadlines. Furthermore, we show that tasks suspension can only be temporary, and prove that a particular definition of idle times can be used to reset the system's criticality level. Finally, we study the performances of our LCT mechanism w.r.t. the classical mechanism that suspends a task as soon as the system criticality level becomes higher than its own criticality.},

Depending on their time-criticality, tasks can be hard or soft real-time and regarding safety-criticality, tasks can be fault-tolerant to transient faults, permanent faults, or have no dependability requirements. We use Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling for the hard tasks and the Constant Bandwidth Server (CBS) for the soft tasks. The CBS parameters determine the quality of service (QoS) of soft tasks. Transient faults are tolerated using checkpointing with rollback recovery. For tolerating permanent faults in processors, we use task migration, i.e., restarting the safety-critical tasks on other processors. We propose a Greedy-based online heuristic for the migration of safety-critical tasks, in response to permanent faults, and the adjustment of CBS parameters on the target processors, such that the faults are tolerated, the deadlines for the hard real-time tasks are satisfied and the QoS for soft tasks is maximized. The proposed online adaptive approach has been evaluated using several synthetic benchmarks and a real-life case study.},

While real-time multicore scheduling approaches help to assure deadlines based on firm theoretical properties, their reliance on task migration poses a significant challenge to timing predictability in practice.

Texting while driving, looking up an address for the navigation system, and taking a phone call are just some common examples that add value for the driver, but also increase the risk of driving. Novel interaction technologies create many opportunities for designing useful and attractive in-car user interfaces. With technologies that assist the user in driving, such as assistive cruise control and lane keeping, the user interface is essential to the way people perceive the driving experience. New means for user interface development and interaction design are required as the number of factors influencing the design space for automotive user interfaces is increasing. In comparison to other domains, a trial and error approach while the product is already in the market is not acceptable as the cost of failure may be fatal. User interface design in the automotive domain is relevant across many areas ranging from primary driving control, to assisted functions, to navigation, information services, entertainment and games.},

The core idea is to let applications declare their temporal characteristics and/or requirements on the CPU allocation, where, for example, some of them may require real-time POSIX priorities, whilst others might need resource reservations through SCHED\_DEADLINE. The framework can properly handle such a set of heterogeneous requirements configuring an underlying multi-core platform so to exploit the various scheduling disciplines that are available in the kernel, matching applications requirements. The framework is realized as a modular architecture in which different plugins handle independently certain real-time scheduling features within the underlying kernel, easing the customization of its behavior to support other schedulers or operating systems by adding further plugins.},

In the context of mixed-critical scheduling theory, we studied the dual criticality problem of scheduling a finite set of hard real-time jobs. In this work we propose an algorithm which is proved to dominate OCBP, a state-of-theart algorithm for this problem that is optimal over fixed job priority algorithms. We show through empirical studies that our algorithm can reduce the set of non-schedulable instances by a factor of two or, under certain assumptions, by a factor of four, when compared to OCBP.},

Dependable systems must evolve to accommodate changes, such as new threats and undesirable events, application updates or variations in available resources. A system that remains dependable when facing changes is called resilient. In this paper, we present an innovative approach taking advantage of component-based software engineering technologies for tackling the on-line adaptation of fault tolerance mechanisms. We propose a development process that relies on two key factors: designing fault tolerance mechanisms for adaptation and leveraging a reflective component-based middleware enabling fine-grained control and modification of the software architecture at runtime. We thoroughly describe the methodology, the development of adaptive fault tolerance mechanisms and evaluate the approach in terms of performance and agility.},

  abstract = {Existing Mixed Criticality System (MCS) task models consider criticality as the relative importance of a task and use it to achieve graceful degradation of the system either by suspending or degrading tasks with relatively lower criticality level than the overloading task. Graceful degradation based on this notion of criticality as a relative parameter may not always be desired. In this paper, we propose a Context-Aware Mixed Criticality System (CA-MCS) model with which each task can be specified with multiple degraded budgets. To handle a system overload due to timing faults i.e. budget overrun of a task, tasks that need to be degraded are chosen irrespective of their criticality level. However, to handle system overload when multiple tasks overrun their budgets, a specific degraded budget of the task chosen for degradation is decided based on the criticality level of the overrun tasks. Experiments performed in a realistic automotive testbed confirm the benefit of CA-MCS model when compared with the state-of-the art degradation strategies. Results show that contextaware degradation gives the ability to degrade the performance in a controlled manner by effectively isolating the effects of degradation between applications. Finally, we derive a sufficient schedulability test under fixed priority scheduling scheme for the CA-MCS model.},

Tasks of different SILs can share a partition only if they are all elevated to the highest SIL among them. Such elevation leads to increased development costs.

In the case of errors, dynamic adaptation can ensure that the best possible system functionality is achieved and that critical functions are kept alive (survivability). Exploiting implicitly available redundancy, dynamic adaptation provides a cost-efficient means to keep up functionalities as long as possible without requiring expensive explicit redundancy channels.Unconstrained dynamic adaptation can lead to emergent, unpredictable behavior, making it inapplicable for safety-critical systems. In this paper, we illustrate how adaptation behavior can be explicitly modeled, analyzed, and verified at design time. By this means, it is possible to use the advantages of dynamic adaptation for the realization of safe and reliable systems.},

As part of the solution, our approach generates an optimized assignment of tasks to computation resources (cores) concerning local memory constraints of cores and criticality constraints of tasks.

The Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) design ensures fairness among tasks using the thread fair scheduling algorithm. This algorithm ensures allocation of resources based on the number of threads in the system and not within executing programs. This can lead to fairness issue in a multi-threaded environment as the Linux scheduler tends to favor programs with higher number of threads. We illustrate the issue of fairness through experimental evaluation thus exposing the weakness of the current allocation scheme where software developers could take advantage by spawning many additional threads in order to obtain more CPU resources. A novel algorithm is proposed as a solution towards achieving better fairness in the Linux scheduler. The algorithm is based on weight readjustment of the threads created in the same process to significantly reduce the unfair allocation of CPU resources in multi-threaded environments. The algorithm was implemented and evaluated. It demonstrated promising results towards solving the raised fairness issue. We conclude this paper highlighting the limitations of the proposed approach and the future work in the stated direction.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a rigorous framework for function modeling of complex multidisciplinary systems based on the system state flow diagram (SSFD). The work addresses the need for a consistent methodology to support solution-neutral function-based system decomposition analysis, facilitating the design, modeling, and analysis of complex systems architectures. A rigorous basis for the SSFD is established by defining conventions for states and function definitions and a representation scheme, underpinned by a critical review of existing literature. A set of heuristics are introduced to support the function decomposition analysis and to facilitate the deployment of the methodology with strong practitioner guidelines. The SSFD heuristics extend the existing framework of Otto and Wood (2001) by introducing a conditional fork node heuristic, to facilitate analysis and aggregation of function models across multiple modes of operation of the system. The empirical validation of the SSFD function modeling framework is discussed in relation to its application to two case studies: a benchmark problem (glue gun) set for the engineering design community; and an industrial case study of an electric vehicle powertrain. Based on the evidence from the two case studies presented in the paper, a critical evaluation of the SSFD function modeling methodology is discussed based on the function benchmarking framework established by Summers et al. (2013), considering the representation, modeling, cognitive, and reasoning characteristics. The significance of this paper is that it establishes a rigorous reference framework for the SSFD function representation and a consistent methodology to guide the practitioner with its deployment, facilitating its impact to industrial practice.},
